<h1>Mutembesa Daniel</h1>
<p> BIO </p>
<p> I am a research scientist & head of collaboration at the Artificial Intelligence and Data Sciebce Research labs in Makerere University,
  focusing on algorithmic game theory, mechanism design, behavioural and forecast modelling in crowdsourcing games and
  applied artificial intelligence in the developing world.
</p>
<p> My core research covers algorithmic mechanism design of community sensing games for
surveillance in agriculture and health, modelling participant behaviour in their unique low-resource settings,
community graph networks, and machine learning models to forecasting of seasonal diseases in rural communities like malaria.
