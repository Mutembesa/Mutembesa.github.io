<head> BIO </head>
<p> I am a research scientist & head of collaboration at the Artificial Intelligence and Data Sciebce Research labs in Makerere University,
  focusing on algorithmic game theory, mechanism design, behavioural and forecast modelling in crowdsourcing games and
  applied artificial intelligence in the developing world.
</p>
<p> My core research covers algorithmic mechanism design of community sensing games for
surveillance in agriculture and health, modelling participant behaviour in their unique low-resource settings,
community graph networks, and machine learning models to forecasting of seasonal diseases in rural communities like malaria.
</p>
<p> My exposure to conservation of ethnographic art forms from 2011-2017, equipped me with unique insights into the
  social value constructs for different communities which when coupled with algorithmic and mathematic techniques,
  can be useful in understanding how to unlock barriers of technology adoption for low-income underserved communities.
Embedded in my research efforts is a responsibility to proactively explore the intersection of social need and
opportunity for computational and mathematical tools to contribute to reducing inequalities for underserved communities in Africa.

<p> Project title: Incentives at Scale; mechanisms for crowdsourcing with smallholder farmers. </p>
<p> Role: Principal Investigator and Researcher. </p>
<p> The main goal is develop dynamic incentive schemes for working with scaled network of volunteer
smallholder farmers on the mobile ad hoc surveillance system, that are adaptable to the changing
utilities of agricultural seasonalities and activities.
We are currently prototyping a scaled ad hoc surveillance system, AdSurv, that offers about
200 smallholder farmers volunteers in Uganda the opportunity to do in-field diagnosis for cassava,
as well as crowdsource surveillance information from their fields and localities in
form of images, labels, farmer group profiles among others. The information from their gardens and localities
serves as a basis for expert recommendations and timely interventions for crop disease outbreaks. </p>
